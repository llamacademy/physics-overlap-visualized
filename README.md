# Physics Overlap, Explained
Everyone talks about Raycasts and Spherecasts, but rarely do I see people talking about the Overlap APIs. Learn about a powerful tool that I feel is under-represented.

Physics OverlapBox, OverlapSphere, and OverlapCapsule are great tools to use when you are looking to find what's around a point in your scene. This can be helpful when trying to find nearby objects, or if there is enough space to put something down.
